# 📚 Enhanced Interactive Learning Assistant (Powered by Ollama LLM)

## 🧩 Overview

This project is a modular and extensible **Interactive Learning Assistant** powered by a local LLM (LLaMA3 via Ollama) and a FastAPI backend. It simulates personalized research, generates structured reports, and enables iterative improvement based on user feedback.

---

## ✅ Expected Deliverables

1. ✅ **Working Prototype**: Handles topic research, report generation, and feedback updates.
2. ✅ **Source Code**: Well-organized and documented in a Dockerized environment.
3. ✅ **Sample Topics & Reports**: Available in the `/samples` folder.
4. ✅ **README File**: (You are reading it) – details setup, architecture, and methodology.
5. ✅ **Sample Input/Output**: Included below.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

> Requires: Docker, Ollama (installed and running locally), Python 3.9+

### 1. Install and Start Ollama
Install Ollama: https://ollama.com

Start the LLaMA3 model:
```bash
ollama run llama3
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Ensure your system has at least **6 GB** free RAM. If not, consider using a lighter model or a cloud-based LLM API.

### 2. Build and Run the Application
```bash
docker build -t learning-assistant .
docker run -p 8000:8000 learning-assistant
```

Access at: `http://localhost:8000/docs` (FastAPI Swagger UI)

└─ Templates (Jinja2)
       └─ HTML Reports
```

- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI
- **LLM**: LLaMA3 via Ollama (local inference)
- **Templating**: Jinja2 for HTML reports
- **Dockerized**: 1-line setup for full system

---

## 🔍 Research Methodology

Prompts are structured and dynamically created to simulate research from:

- 🌐 General web content
- 🎥 Video transcripts (simulated)
- 📚 Academic-style literature

This method enables **context-aware** content generation without live crawling.

---

## 🎯 Personalization Approach

The system adapts responses based on:

- 💡 User interest (technical, creative, academic)
- 📈 Skill level (beginner, intermediate, expert)
- 📘 Preferred format (summary, full report, Q&A)

Interactive Q&A helps refine reports progressively.

---

## 📝 Report Generation

- **Structured Output**: Sections build from fundamentals to advanced topics.
- **Enhanced Content**:
  - Diagrams & visual resource links
  - Summaries and explanations
  - References and follow-up suggestions
- **Templated Reports** using Jinja2

---

## 🔄 Report Modification API

**Endpoint**: `/update-report`

Allows:
- Feedback-driven modifications
- Regeneration of specific sections
- Personalization tuning

---

## 📥 Sample Input/Output

### 🎯 Input Prompt:
```json
{
  "topic": "Quantum Computing for Beginners",
  "audience_level": "beginner",
  "format": "structured_report"
}
```

### 🧾 Output:
```html
<h1>Introduction to Quantum Computing</h1>
<p>Quantum computing leverages quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once...</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Superposition</li>
  <li>Entanglement</li>
  <li>Quantum Gates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Resources</h3>
<p><a href="https://example.com/quantum-visual">Quantum Concepts in Visuals</a></p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>To dive deeper, explore Qiskit by IBM...</p>
```

🧪 Sample reports can be found in `/samples/reports/`

## 🚫 Limitations

- ❌ Ollama LLM must be running locally – high memory usage (~6 GB).
- ❌ No live data fetching – all research is simulated.
- ❌ UI not implemented – currently backend API only.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 🔐 Persistent user sessions with history
- 📄 PDF export and bookmarking
- 📚 Vector store for user memory/contextual follow-up
- 🌐 Optional cloud LLM fallback (for low-RAM systems)
- 🎛️ Web-based frontend UI

---
